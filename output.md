the little boy and the magical doctor

once upon a time, in a small village, there was a little boy named tim. tim had bright **eye (1)**s and curly **hair (2)**. he loved to play outside with his friends. one day, while playing, tim fell down and **hurt (34)** his **knee (13)**. it was a **pain (35)**ful ache, and he started to cry. his friends took him home.

tim's mom saw him crying and immediately **check (40)**ed his **knee (13)**. she said, "we need to see the **dentist (29)**," but tim corrected her, "mom, it's not my **tooth (5)**, it's my **knee (13)**!" they both laughed.

the next day, tim and his mom went to the hospital. they met a doctor named dr. wise. dr. wise had a kind h**ear (4)**t and a sharp **brain (15)**. he looked at tim's **knee (13)** and said, "don't worry, you just **have (24)** a small bruise."

dr. wise gave tim a **soap (30)** bubble blower to play with. "blowing bubbles will make you **feel (38)** better," he smiled. tim started blowing bubbles, and amazingly, his **pain (35)** began to fade away.

while at the hospital, tim noticed other patients. there was a girl with a **tooth (5)**ache, a man with a **headache (18)**, and an old lady who had caught a cold. dr. wise treated everyone with care. he gave **medicine (31)** to the **sick (45)**, put a bandage on **burn (36)**s, and made everyone **feel (38)** better.

tim asked dr. wise, "how do you help everyone?" dr. wise rep**lie (42)**d, "i listen to their **problem (33)**s and help them solve them. helping others is the best **medicine (31)** for the h**ear (4)**t."

tim l**ear (4)**ned a lot that day. he l**ear (4)**ned that helping others can make you **feel (38)** happy. 

after a few days, tim's **knee (13)** was better, and he was ready to play again. he thanked dr. wise and promised to always be careful. he also promised to help his friends if they ever got **hurt (34)**.

and from that day on, tim was known as the bravest and kindest boy in the village.
