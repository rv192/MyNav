The Little Boy and the Magical Doctor

Once upon a time, in a small village, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had bright eyes and curly hair. He loved to play outside with his friends. One day, while playing, Tim fell down and hurt his knee. It was a painful ache, and he started to cry. His friends took him home.

Tim's mom saw him crying and immediately checked his knee. She said, "We need to see the dentist," but Tim corrected her, "Mom, it's not my tooth, it's my knee!" They both laughed.

The next day, Tim and his mom went to the hospital. They met a doctor named Dr. Wise. Dr. Wise had a kind heart and a sharp brain. He looked at Tim's knee and said, "Don't worry, you just have a small bruise."

Dr. Wise gave Tim a soap bubble blower to play with. "Blowing bubbles will make you feel better," he smiled. Tim started blowing bubbles, and amazingly, his pain began to fade away.

While at the hospital, Tim noticed other patients. There was a girl with a toothache, a man with a headache, and an old lady who had caught a cold. Dr. Wise treated everyone with care. He gave medicine to the sick, put a bandage on burns, and made everyone feel better.

Tim asked Dr. Wise, "How do you help everyone?" Dr. Wise replied, "I listen to their problems and help them solve them. Helping others is the best medicine for the heart."

Tim learned a lot that day. He learned that helping others can make you feel happy. 

After a few days, Tim's knee was better, and he was ready to play again. He thanked Dr. Wise and promised to always be careful. He also promised to help his friends if they ever got hurt.

And from that day on, Tim was known as the bravest and kindest boy in the village.
